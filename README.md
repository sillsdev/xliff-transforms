XliffTmxMd
==========

Perform XSLT 2.0 transform to convert Xliff localization files into Tmx or Md files.

Usage:
The installer will create a folder link on the Desktop (also there is a link on the start menu.) In this folder, you will find ConvertXliff.bat
You can select and drag up to 9 .xlf files onto this .bat file and the converted files will be created in the same folder as the .xlf file.
